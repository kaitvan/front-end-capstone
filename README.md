# Front-End Capstone

Whirly is a self-care app that allows users to curate a list of self-care ideas. The user will be able to use all CRUD functionality to create their list, including both a category for each item and an estimated amount of time for the activity. When the user finds themselves in need of some self-care, the user can use a filter to select a category and a time limit for the activity and then spin the wheel to choose a self-care activity. Future iterations can include a library of self-care options for users to choose from and a log of all activities completed.
